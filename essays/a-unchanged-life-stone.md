## One dream... Only dream...

I had a dream, and it is my dream now. Yes, a dream that started in junior high school, and I have never changed my dream. It all started when I noticed something unusual in my family. I grew up in a great family; my parents were very successful. But also a person who possessed a very hard-to-perceive flaw. The Chinese early 21st-century style of education was very extreme, but it was also very effective; it was domestic violence, or to be precise, the use of violence against children. I used to think it was a very average family (but it wasn't). When I couldn't stand the violence, I liked to study in my room by myself. This made me self-reliant, and I think I was more mature than any other young child. Still, because of my father's irresponsible teaching, I also lacked the knowledge to have regular contact and socialization with others.

My father was very well-connected, and his friends liked to give me books I didn't like. Because they liked the idea that I could be like my father, these books were deep, and I didn't think I could understand most of them. And one of them caught my eye, and it was a book on learning Java. It was a Chinese translation of a textbook with interesting descriptions as well as very appealing examples. So although I only understood Java partially, it laid the foundation for my first ICS course. It also helped me to take a successful step out of the shadow of my family because I had aspirations, and I could endure anything for that.

## Keep approaching

I first started utilizing Java when I was at a science fair in high school. I wanted to create a program about security (which I now look at and feel is the right direction). An OTP program that could send from OTP to the user's email. And the user can choose the files they need to encrypt, from which they can use the OTP random and unique password to encrypt them. This is classic encryption from a random password to arrange the binary code of the file. And this file I want to save this to a cloud server, but I need more funds to buy a cloud server. So I only managed to test the functionality except for the cloud server. It was an exciting project, but I abandoned it because of the difficulty of maintaining the program. And that was my last year of high school doing something about programming.

Then I went to college and chose data science as my major. Because of my high school project, I discovered my interest in data processing and analysis. And as the courses got progressively more complex, my grades could have improved in my first two years of college. But I managed to keep up with most of them and escaped a few "knockouts." So I am very excited to see how the rest of my college career will unfold.

## Future Roadmap

Because of the environment I grew up in. I like to think and consider my plans constantly. And most of them are very romantic and challenging. I have often failed in these challenges, but I have also gained experience. Later in college, I want to get involved in internships and even part-time jobs. I want to create projects to help with my computer research (which is often what I need now). While I have a lot of artistic strengths and ideas, I want to find something that allows me to utilize those strengths better. And in that, I thought of game design. And that's why I got involved with ICS 369; I wanted to get behind the game from the player's perspective. And I wanted to learn something else. I also wanted to experience some projects or courses about UX design. And currently, I'm discussing and learning from one of my UX designer friends. And finally, I would like to return to what I said before: "I like to keep thinking and considering what I want to do in the future. And it's mostly very ambitious and challenging, but I often fail." So I will try harder to make more goals to show.
